            <p>Golden Horse Medical Supplies is a brick-and-mortar retail shop for various medical supplies specializing in wheelchairs.</p>
            <p>For the look of the site, the client wanted to keep the distinct striking red because in Chinese it is a symbol for luck. Based on a generic theme, I modified the stylesheet and image assets such as buttons to fit this color scheme. I also prepared the banner images on the homepage to attract and entice more visitors to go through the site.</p>
            <p>Due to their high volume of products and special shipping calculation requirements, we opted to go with <a href='http://www.volusion.com' target="_blank">Volusion</a>. I set up the domain, email, e-commerce store variables and instructed their staff on product uploads and order management. I also configured the shipping configuration to set the correct rates for domestic shipping in the Philippines, especially since their product lines ranges from small to bulky items.</p>
